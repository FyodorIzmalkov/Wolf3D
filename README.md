# Wolf3D
Wolfenstein 3D is a project made by me and my teammate [Olesgedz](https://github.com/olesgedz) in school21.
It uses raycasting to draw all the things. Textures are 64x64. It is not totally remake of Wolf3d just the basis part that looks like it. Made by using SDL.
#### Usage
make, wait for install, then just run it with a map: ./wolf3d map.txt
It'll work only on MACos.
